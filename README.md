- Hi, I’m @Icefox339
- I’m interested in some programming(So, I just rapidly hit keys on my keyboard.).
- I’m currently learning Python, CSS, HTML, JavaScript (I know what does console.log()). [little update after 4 years: now I'm also in C, C++, C# and Assembly x86).
- I’m looking to collaborate on something.
- How to reach me:
-   Discord: Icefox#8108
-   Telegram: @Icefox339
- That's enough
