- Hi, I’m @Icefox339
- I’m interested in some programming(So, I just rapidly hit keys on my keyboard.).
- I’m currently learning Python, CSS, HTML, JavaScript (I know what does console.log()). 
- I’m looking to collaborate on nothing. (Because I'm schewpid but if you wish, then...).
- I absolutely have no sense about punctuation rules in English.
- How to reach me:
-   Discord: Icefox#8108
-   Telegram: @Icefox339
- That's enough
